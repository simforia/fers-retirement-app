**SEPP (Substantially Equal Periodic Payments):**  
A method to withdraw from your retirement savings without incurring the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you retire before age 59¬Ω. Payments are fixed and continue for at least 5 years or until you reach 59¬Ω (whichever is longer).

**Age 55 Rule:**  
For federal employees retiring directly (like via VERA) at age 55 or older in the same calendar year, TSP withdrawals are penalty-free.

**Pension Calculations:**  
- **Regular FERS Pension:** Calculated as High-3 Salary * 1% * Years of Service * 0.9  
- **Disability FERS Pension:** Calculated as High-3 Salary * (0.6 if under 62, otherwise 0.4)

Adjust the inputs above to see how changes in your service years or salary impact your final pension.

### üîÅ **Key Logic Points**
- **Age 55 at separation** is the penalty cutoff under standard FERS TSP rules.
- **VERA eligibility does NOT automatically waive the TSP penalty** if you're under 55.
- **Public safety employees (LEO, FF, ATC)** may be exempt starting at **age 50**, not reflected here.
- Use this logic to decide whether to delay TSP withdrawals, set up SEPP, or take penalty-hit withdrawals.

**Federal Independent Contractor Steps:**

1. **Determine Your Small Business Status:**  
   - Review the [SBA Table of Size Standards](https://www.sba.gov/document/support--table-size-standards) to determine if your business qualifies as a small business.  
   - Consider your annual revenue and number of employees.

2. **Identify Your NAICS Code:**  
   - Use resources like the [Census NAICS Code Finder](https://www.census.gov/naics/) to match your products or services with the appropriate NAICS code.  
   - A correct NAICS code is essential for federal contracting opportunities.

3. **Set Up Your Business Entity:**  
   - **LLC (Limited Liability Company):**  
     - Provides liability protection similar to a corporation with the tax flexibility of a partnership.  
     - Profits and losses "pass through" to members unless you elect S-corp or C-corp taxation.
   - **S-corporation (S-corp):**  
     - Offers potential tax savings by passing income through to shareholders, with restrictions on the number and type of shareholders.
   - **C-corporation (C-corp):**  
     - Involves corporate taxation and potential double taxation on dividends but allows for more complex capital structures.

4. **Register in the System for Award Management (SAM):**  
   - Mandatory for federal contracting. Visit [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/) to register your business and obtain a federal tax ID (EIN) if needed.

5. **Explore Contract Opportunities:**  
   - Use [SAM.gov](https://sam.gov/) to search for federal contract solicitations.  
   - Consider subcontracting with established federal contractors to build your track record.
